In this lab I am using my Asus ROG GU603 laptop as a router/default gateway.
My GU603 is connected to my home WiFi and Iâ€™ve set up my connection to share internet access downlink on the NIC. 
The NIC is connected to an SFP on ge-0/2/0 on FORD-JUN-SW1.
FORD-JUN-SW1 has a default route pointing to the NIC on GU603.
FORD-JUN-SW1 has DHCP services for VLAN 10 and 20 and has 3 access ports for VLAN 10.
FORD-JUN-SW1 connects to FORD-JUN-SW2 through an etherchannel trunk bundled with 2 cables into SFPs on ports ge-0/2/1-2.
FORD-JUN-SW2 is mainly layer 2 and has 3 access ports for VLAN 20.
FORD-JUN-SW1 and FORD-JUN-SW2 can both be SSHd via the Asus ROG GU603 using VLAN 99.
FORD-JUN-SW2 has a static route pointing to the VLAN 99 interface of FORD-JUN-SW1
Both switches have an Admin and Viewer account with different levels of privilege.
Asus ROG GU603 has routes pointing to VLAN 10,20, and 99 from the NIC.
